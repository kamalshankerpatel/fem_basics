## Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples, you need to install docker on your system. You need Windows 10/11 Education or Professional for this to work. This does not work on Windows 10/11 Home.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/)
* [CMDER](https://cmder.net/) (Only for Windows) (After installation, open `cmder` and then go to Settings(Win+Alt+P)âž¡import and choose the `cmlab.xml` provided in the repository.)

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (After installation, open Chrome and paste the following in the address bar, `chrome://flags/.` In the flags screen, enable `WebGL Developer Extensions` )


## Install FEniCS

Once the docker system is installed and running, open CMDER/terminal and run:

```
docker pull iitrabhi/fenics_notebook
```

## Running

To start the notebook server, use the following:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v host_system_path:/root/ -w /root/ iitrabhi/fenics_notebook
```

Note: you should replace the variable `host_system_path` with the path of the folder that contains your code. e.g., If  `D:\Codes` contains your code, then to start the command line interface, you have to run:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v D:\Codes:/root/ -w /root/ iitrabhi/fenics_notebook
```

Once you run the above command in `cmder,` you will get a URL starting with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab`. Press Control and click on the URL to open a new Jupyter Notebook.

## If you have Windows home

You can use google collab to run FEniCS on the cloud. [Open Collab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/), upload your notebook and paste the following in the first cell of your notebook.

``` copy
try:
    import dolfin
except ImportError:
    !wget "https://fem-on-colab.github.io/releases/fenics-install.sh" -O "/tmp/fenics-install.sh" && bash "/tmp/fenics-install.sh"
    import dolfin
```
