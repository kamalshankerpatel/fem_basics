## Where to find help

When in doubt about any specific FEniCS command or implementation, there are several resources you can refer to for clarification and assistance:

1. **FEniCS Book:** The official FEniCS book is an invaluable resource. It provides comprehensive documentation, tutorials, examples, and detailed explanations of all FEniCS functionalities. You can find it at: [The FEniCS Book](https://fenicsproject.org/book/)
2. **FEniCS Q&A Forum:** The FEniCS Q&A forum is an active community where users and developers discuss issues, ask questions, and share knowledge about FEniCS. You can post your questions here and get help from experienced FEniCS users and developers. Access the forum at [FEniCS discourse](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/)
3. **FEniCS Workshop Slack channel:** You can also join the FEniCS workshop community on Slack to connect with other users, developers, and experts in the field. Slack is an excellent platform for real-time discussions, sharing knowledge, and getting help with FEniCS-related topics. You can join the Slack community by using [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/fenicsworkshop/shared_invite/zt-1zqrdlvmr-LziJQ59NdEOBzn7YZf59hg). 
4. **FEniCS online documentation:** The online documentation since V1.3.0 is available at [this link](https://fenicsproject.org/olddocs/dolfin/). You can go into the python folder of any version to find the syntax and meaning of different commands. The latest version is not that descriptive, and thus I recommend checking out older documentation, as most of the commands are the same.

Note: Please go through the official community [page here](https://fenicsproject.org/community/).
